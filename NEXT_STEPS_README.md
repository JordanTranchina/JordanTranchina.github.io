# Next Steps for Jordan Tranchina Portfolio Site

## 1. About Me Section Layout (Desktop)
- Issue: On non-mobile (desktop/tablet) screens, the About Me section is only on the left side of the page. It should span both left and right, centered or more balanced.
- Next Step: Update the grid or flex layout for the About Me section to use more columns or center the content.

## 2. Get in Touch Button Styling
- Issue: The "Get in touch" button is currently blue with white text. Change it to a white button with blue text for a cleaner look.
- Next Step: Update the button's Tailwind classes to use a white background and blue text, and adjust hover/focus states for accessibility.

## 3. Mobile Header Consistency
- Issue: On mobile, the top bar/header looks different from desktop. You prefer the desktop look. Hide the Home, About, and hamburger links on mobile, and show only your logo (replace the hamburger with your logo).
- Next Step: Adjust the header's responsive classes so that on mobile, only the logo is visible, and navigation links/hamburger are hidden.
