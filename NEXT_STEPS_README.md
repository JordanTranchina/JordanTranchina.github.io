# Next Steps for Jordan Tranchina Portfolio Site

## 1. About Me Section Layout (Desktop)
- Issue: On non-mobile (desktop/tablet) screens, the About Me section is only on the left side of the page. It should span both left and right, centered or more balanced.
- Next Step: Update the grid or flex layout for the About Me section to use more columns or center the content.

## 2. Get in Touch Button Styling
- Issue: The "Get in touch" button is currently blue with white text. Change it to a white button with blue text for a cleaner look.
- Next Step: Update the button's Tailwind classes to use a white background and blue text, and adjust hover/focus states for accessibility.

## 3. Mobile Header Consistency
- Issue: On mobile, the top bar/header looks different from desktop. You prefer the desktop look. Hide the Home, About, and hamburger links on mobile, and show only your logo (replace the hamburger with your logo).
- Next Step: Adjust the header's responsive classes so that on mobile, only the logo is visible, and navigation links/hamburger are hidden.

## Implementation Plan
1. Fix the About Me section layout for desktop.
2. Update the "Get in touch" button styling.
3. Make the mobile header match the desktop style (logo only, no links/hamburger).
